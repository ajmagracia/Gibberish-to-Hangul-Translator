<h1 align="center">Gibberish to Hangul Translator</h1>

## Description

Gibberish to Hangul Translator is meant to translate the gibberish characters
that appear when one types a Korean name/word on a standard QWERTY keyboard,
often used as usernames in lieu of something actually readable in English, into
the Hangul they represent. For example, K-Pop Star IU uses the name "dlwlrma"
on Instagram, which, from QWERTY, directly transposes to 이지금 on a Korean
layout.

One could very easily swap keyboard layouts and type the letters themselves to
determine the word, but I'm lazy. But not too lazy to write the code to do it
for me, I guess.

## Usage

Highlight and right click the desired text and open the parent menu item
labeled "Translate gibberish to Hangul". The translated text will appear
as a sub-menu item.
